# DesignPatterns
1) A note keeping application that uses both Composite and State design patterns.
2) A 2D console application that simulates a Battle Game which uses both Factory and Decorator design patterns.
3) A desktop application that resembles Video-sharing platforms which uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and Observer design pattern.

PS: In the each design pattern file, the file with .drawio extension shows the visualized version of the design patterns.
